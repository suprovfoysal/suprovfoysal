*<h2>Description-</h2>I have worked on different parts of various projects mainly for learning purposes. Instead of completing entire projects, I focused on developing specific skills such as modeling, texturing, lighting, animation, and rendering. This approach allowed me to gain deep knowledge and hands-on experience in each area. With these experiences, I am fully capable of handling complete projects efficiently.*
